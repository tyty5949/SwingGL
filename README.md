# SwingGL
A library that uses the Java OpenGL port LWJGL to render UI elements and other 2D sprites much like Java Swing. It features customizable elements housed in a singular sprite-sheet for maximum performance. It also included a variable multi-threaded game loop that can be altered to run differently on the fly. The goal is to create a versatile engine that will allow quick creation of complex yet efficient UI's and 2D games.
